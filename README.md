# Games
This is a collection of the games I have created during my time at the University of Denver 

This includes a basic 2D platformer game, a 3D 'collectathon' game, a Tank shooter game, a destruction-based game titled "Point Breakers", and a clone of the classic snake game

All work shown was done solely by me

(Worlds Between, 2D and 3D Games made with Unity and coded in C# on Visual Studio, Tank and Point Breakers created with C++ and Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5, Snake Game made in Eclipse IDE with Java)

# Capstone Game: Worlds Between
A top-down, dimension-hopping roguelike


After getting lost in the multiverse, path your way through countless worlds to find your way home

Combine items from all dimensions to create your perfect playstyle

This capstone project is a top-down, 2D shooter in which you must traverse three different universes in order to find artifacts that can bring you home. Switch weapons in accordance with the enemy you are facing and find the gap in their defenses.
