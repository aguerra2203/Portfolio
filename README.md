# Games
This is a collection of the games I have created during my time at the University of Denver 

This includes a basic 2D platformer game, a 3D 'collectathon' game, a Tank shooter game, a destruction-based game titled "Point Breakers", and a clone of the classic snake game

All work shown was done solely by me

(2D and 3D Games made with Unity and coded in C# on Visual Studio, Tank and Point Breakers created with C++ and Blueprints in Unreal Engine 5, Snake Game made in Eclipse IDE with Java)
